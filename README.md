## Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor

### Overview

This project aims to predict the success of funding applications to Alphabet Soupâ€™s charity using machine learning and neural networks. Starting with an initial model, we employed hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner to optimize performance. The project's challenge was to surpass a target predictive accuracy of 75%.

### Phase 1: Initial Model Development

#### Data Preprocessing
Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL indicates if the funding was used effectively.

Features Used: EIN and NAME were dropped as identifiers, leaving all other column data as features used for the model.

#### Model Configuration
A neural network model with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer was compiled and evaluated.

#### Training and Initial Results
The model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 72.47%, indicating room for improvement.


### Phase 2: Model Optimization with Keras Tuner

#### Hyperparameter Tuning
Employed Keras Tuner to explore various architectures and configurations. Optimizations included testing different layers, units, and activation functions.

#### Results
Accuracy: Upon final evaluation on the test set, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 72.64%, serving as the measure of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

### Conclusion and Future Directions

The optimized model shows promising results, with a test accuracy of 72.64%. While still shy of the 75% target, the improvements demonstrate the value of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing model performance.
