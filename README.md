## Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor

### Overview

This project aims to predict the success of funding applications to Alphabet Soupâ€™s charity using machine learning and neural networks. Starting with an initial model, we employed hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner to optimize performance. The project's challenge was to surpass a target predictive accuracy of 75%.

### Phase 1: Initial Model Development

#### Data Preprocessing

Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL indicates if the funding was used effectively.
Features Used: Includes APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, etc., while EIN and NAME were dropped as identifiers.

#### Model Configuration

A neural network model with an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer was compiled and evaluated.
Training and Initial Results
The model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 72%, indicating room for improvement.

### Phase 2: Model Optimization with Keras Tuner

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

Employed Keras Tuner to explore various architectures and configurations.

Optimizations included testing different layers, units, and activation functions.

#### Results

Validation Accuracy: The best model configuration reached a validation accuracy of 74% during tuning.

Test Accuracy: Upon final evaluation on the test set, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 72%, serving as the measure of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

### Conclusion

The optimized model shows promising results, with a test accuracy of 72%. While just shy of the 75% target, the improvements demonstrate the value of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing model performance.

### Recommendations
Further Tuning: Additional rounds of tuning with an expanded search space might uncover more optimal configurations.
Advanced Feature Engineering: Investigating deeper into the features could reveal new insights for model improvement.

Exploring Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models could enhance overall accuracy.
